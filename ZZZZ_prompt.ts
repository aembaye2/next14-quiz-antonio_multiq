//I have the following drawableCanvas.tsx component that has the downloadcallback2 function executed with onClick button. It let's the user to save in a file the json representation of the canvas drawing. This component is deployed in Quiz.tsx component that collects user's answers (userAnswers) of different type of questions. The only problem is I want the json drawing to be also included as the user's answer but there is no onChange method on the canvas but there is onClick. How do I change the latter to the former? The other problem is that the callback funcition that creates the json represntation is in the drawableCanvas component but the userAnswer state is in the Quiz componen
